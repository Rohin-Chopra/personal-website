# Backlog

This folder contains the project backlog and improvement tracking.

## Files

- **BACKLOG.md** - Main backlog document with prioritized improvement items

## How to Use

1. **Review the backlog regularly** - Check items that align with current goals
2. **Prioritize items** - Focus on High Priority items first, but don't ignore quick wins
3. **Break down large items** - Some items may need to be split into smaller tasks
4. **Update status** - Mark items as complete when done (change `[ ]` to `[x]`)
5. **Add new items** - As you discover new improvements, add them to the appropriate priority section

## Priority Levels

- **🔴 High Priority** - Critical improvements that should be addressed soon
- **🟡 Medium Priority** - Important improvements that can be planned for later
- **🟢 Low Priority** - Nice-to-have improvements and enhancements

## Contributing

When adding new items:
- Be specific about what needs to be done
- Consider the impact and effort required
- Place items in the appropriate priority section
- Add context or links if helpful
